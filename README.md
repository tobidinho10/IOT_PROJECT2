# 🛍️ E-Commerce Website (Full-Stack Starter)

A simple full-stack e-commerce website built with Node.js (Express) for the backend and **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.

  - Supports CORS for frontend integration

  How to run
  - cd ecommerce-backend
  - npm start


- **Frontend ( JS)**

  - Add-to-cart functionality with real-time cart updates
  - Mock checkout (creates an order in backend)
